# Titanic machine learning exercise
In this exercise, I trained a logistic regression model as a part of the Titanic machine learning comptetion on Kaggle. The data and instructions are available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic). Sharing of the data is restricted, so the repository does not contain the training and test CSV files. So the Jupyter notebook is not expected to display the results.

I have used a Jupyter Notebook for working with the data using Python. I used Pandas DataFrames and scikit-learn for data handling and training the ML model. Check the file [here](https://github.com/Atharv-Gokhale/titanic-machine-learning-exercise/blob/main/Titanic%20Machine%20Learning%20Exercise.ipynb).
