# Titanic machine learning exercise
In this exercise, I trained a logistic regression model to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic. The data and instructions are available on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic).

I have used a Jupyter Notebook for working with the data using Python. I used Pandas DataFrames for handling the data, Matplotlib and Seaborn for creating data visualizations, and scikit-learn for data handling and training an ML model.

Check the Jupyter Notebook [here]() for details.
